Time-Series Based Early Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Detection ü©∫üìä  

Project Overview  
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection of CVDs can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages **time-series data from wearable devices** to develop an **AI/ML model for early CVD detection**.  

Features  
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Processes wearable device data such as heart rate, blood pressure, and activity levels.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements supervised and unsupervised learning for early-stage CVD prediction.  
- **Deep Learning (Optional)**: Uses LSTM/GRU for sequential pattern recognition.    
- **Scalability**: Can be integrated with real-time health monitoring systems.  

Dataset  
The dataset consists of time-series health data collected from wearable devices. It includes features such as:  
- **Heart Rate (BPM)**  
- **Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)**  
- **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)**  
- **Physical Activity Levels**  
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG) Readings**  

Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python üêç  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for deep learning)  
- **ML Models**: Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, LSTM/GRU  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
